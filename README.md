## Overview


Earthquake Data Analysis is an extensive project leveraging the capabilities of Azure services and GitHub to streamline the collection, processing, and analysis of critical earthquake data. Drawing inspiration from similar projects, this endeavor seamlessly acquires data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and applies Azure Data Factory for efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The data is then deposited into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for centralized storage and further undergoes transformations and exploratory analysis using Azure Databricks. Azure Key Vault plays a pivotal role in ensuring the security of sensitive credentials and secrets. Processed data is stored in an Azure SQL Database for optimized querying, with Azure Data Lake Gen2 serving as an intermediary and repository for refined datasets. Ultimately, the project utilizes Tableau to create dashboards that offer valuable insights into recent seismic activities."
